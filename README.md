# odin-recipes
This repository contains the code for "odin-recipes", the first project in [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) Foundations Course for Full-Stack Development.

The goal is to utilize HTML to create a website with links to different recipes. In the process, the project will serve as a milestone to mark HTML proficiency, despite the "ugly" appearance that may come from not yet using CSS.
